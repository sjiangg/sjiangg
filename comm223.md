##### New product development

- Why new product

    - Focusing on finding new ways to solve customer problems and create more customer-satisfying experiences
  
  - Team-based new product development:
    
    - Various company departments work closely together, overlapping the steps in the product development process to save time and increase effectiveness.

- New product development strategy
  
  - Developing new products through the firm’s own research and development efforts
  
  - Creating successful new products requires

##### Product life cycle

  **Product life cycle**(PLC): the course of a product’s <u>sales and profits over its life</u> Competition and rate of technology change can influence the length of a PLC
Useful for planning purposes 

##### **Product Development Stage**

Sales are zero, profits are negative which is the money spent on development

###### Introduction Stage

- The new product is introduced to the market

- Sales start at zero and begin to climb slowly; profits continue to decline due to costs of launching the product

- Pricing strategy: <u>skimming or penetration</u>

- Distribution: not all outlets covered as some may not want the risk

###### Growth Stage

- Sales of the new product begin to climb quickly as awareness within the target market(s) builds

- Profits may become positive as development and launch costs are recovered and the company achieves economies of scale

- Pressure on pricing as competition increases

- Distribution increases as the product becomes more known

- <img src="file:///C:/Users/shanshan/AppData/Roaming/marktext/images/2022-04-14-21-32-33-image.png" title="" alt="" width="485">

###### Maturity Stage

- Sales of the new product continue to climb and then peak as the majority of the target market(s) have tried the product

- Profits continue to grow and stay positive throughout

- Competition is most intense at this stage; many versions and brands

- Strategies to prolong this stage:
  Modify the market
  Modify the product
  Modify the marketing mix

- Some products stay in this stage for an indefinite period. Others are replaced by new technology and fade rapidly
  
  ###### Decline Stage

- Sales of the new product drop quickly as the target market(s) move on to other things

- Profits decline as competitive pressures force lower prices 

- Competition has declined as weaker brands have left the market

- Companies need to make decisions about what to do with the declining product
    <u>Maintain </u>spending levels to fight it out for what is left
    <u>Harvest </u>by cutting spending and riding it out
    <u>Drop </u>the product and move on to the next thing

##### Problem of Using PLC

Hard to identify which stage of PLC the product is in

Difficult to forecast the sales level, the length of each stage, and shape of the PLC

Strategy is both a cause and a result of the PLC

## pricing

- What is price
  
  - Price is the only marketing mix element that produces revenue, Most flexible element

- Major pricing strategies
  
  - Cost-Based Pricing
    
    - Based on the costs of producing, distributing, and selling the product plus a fair rate of return for effort and risk
    
    - Variable Cost + Fixed Costs/Unit Sales = Unit Cost
    
    - Unit Cost/(1 – Desired Return on Sales) = Markup Price

Markup is **the difference between a product's selling price and cost as a percentage of the cost**. For example, if a product sells for $125 and costs $100, the additional price increase is ($125 – $100) / $100) x 100 = 25%.

-      Break-even pricing (target return pricing) 盈亏平衡定价法
  
  - Setting a price to break even on the costs of making and marketing a product, or setting the price to make a target return

- Customer Value-Based Pricing
  
  - Based on buyers’ perceptions of value rather than on the seller’s cost
    
    - Good-value pricing
      Offering just the right combination of quality and good service at a fair price
       Everyday low pricing (EDLP) vs. high-low pricing
    
    - Value-added pricing
      Attaching value-added features and services to differentiate a company’s offers and charging higher prices
    
    - Competition-based pricing:
      Setting prices based on competitors’ strategies, costs, prices, and market offerings

- Factors influencing price decision
  
  - Internal factors
    
    - Overall marketing strategy, objectives, and mix
      Organizational considerations
  
  - External factors
    
    - Market and demand
      Economy
      Impact on other parties in its environment

- New product pricing
  
  - :<u> Market-Penetration Pricing</u>
    
    - Setting a low price to attract a large number of buyers and a large market share
      
      - Usually sacrifices profitability
        May ignite a price war
    
    - price skimming
      
      - a high, premium price for the new product with the intention to reduce the price in the future.

- Product mix pricing
  
  - Bundle

  - Why marketing channel
    
    - Channel level: A layer of intermediaries that performs work in bringing the product and its ownership closer to the final buyer
  
  - Channel behavior
    
    - Channel Conflict
      Occurs when channel members disagree on roles, activities, or rewards.
      
      - Horizontal conflict: occurs among firms at the same channel level
        例如，某一地区经营A家企业产品的中间商，可能认为同一地区经营A家企业产品的另一家中间商在定价、促销和售后服务等方面过于进取，抢了他们的，生意。 
      
      - Vertical conflict:  occurs among firms at different channel levels。例如，某些批发商可能会抱怨生产企业在价格方面控制太紧，留给自己的利润空间太小
    
    - Conventional Distribution Channels
      
      - **传统渠道**系统是指有各自独立的生产商、批发商、零售商和消费者组成的**分销渠道**。 **传统渠道**成员之间的系统结构是松散的。
    
    - Vertical Marketing Systems
      
      - 垂直营销系统是由生产者、批发商和零售商所组成的统一联合体。
      
      - 与传统营销渠道中生产者、批发商和零售商相互独立不同，能有利于控制渠道行动，并通过其规模、谈判实力和减少重复服务等获取利益。
      
      - 三种主要实现形式：
        
        - （1)Corporate VMS公司式是通过产权联系起来的渠道系统；
        
        - （2)Contractual VMS契约式是通过订立契约以协调各方关系的渠道一体化系统；
        
        - （3)Administered VMS管理式则是在没有产权和契约机制前提下，通过实力来协调渠道关系的渠道系统。
    
    - Horizontal Marketing Systems
    
    - Multichannel Distribution Systems
      
      - Advantages:    Expanding sales    Tailoring channels
      
      - disadvantage:    
    
    - Changing Channel Organization
  
  - Channel decision
    
    - Step 1: Analyzing Consumer Needs
    
    - Step 2: Setting Channel Objectives
    
    - Step 3: Identifying Major Alternatives
      
      - Types of intermediaries refers to channel members available to carry out channel work
      
      - Intensive distribution     As many outlets as possible
        Exclusive distribution    More than one, but not all outlets
        Selective distribution     One outlet per market area
    
    - Step 4: Evaluating Major Alternatives
    
    International Channels: 
    
    Channel strategies should be adapted to the existing structures within each country.
    Distribution systems can have many layers and a large number of intermediaries.
    Customs and government regulations can restrict distribution in global markets.
